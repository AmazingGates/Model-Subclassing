Model-Subclassing

This is a demonstration project centered on the process of Model Sub Classing

It's important to note that model subclassing permits us to create recursively composable layers and models.

Now, what does that mean?

This means that we could create a layer where its attributes are other layers, and this layer tracks the weights
and biases of the sub layers.
